1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project went over creating a 12 and 24 hour clocks that ran at the same time and were able too be changed by adding minutes, seconds, and hours one at a time when the user inputs there choice. 

2. What did you do particularly well?
My progam ran well and outputted proper information to the user, it was neat and clear and showed both clocks and instruction in a organized fashion. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
A few ways my code would be enhanced is by adding a running code to it so the clock woudl also be running and showing real time taking data from the users computer to show real time. It could also be enhanced with a nicer clock setup.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Te most challenging part was adding the if and else statments so that they would run correctly, I overcame this with youtube videos which helped to show me some tips as well as writing out what I wanted to do and then goign through my code such as a map to see where my problems were.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A skill that I will take from this will be the proper use of if and else statments which will come super usefull mvoing foward as it helps with creatign code that may come with multiple options and helps the user options claute right isnide the code an diutput correctly.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This code covers the above questions in mutliple ways its maintainable because it runs correctly and coninues tor un back to back without any errors or bugs its also readbale by my added inline text which help to explain the code and what each acronym means, laslty its adaptable because with being able to read each acronym the user can use each one and input them into new line sof ode to add diffrent clocks such as clocks that read diffrent imes aroudn the world the main code is there which can be added and improved down the road.
